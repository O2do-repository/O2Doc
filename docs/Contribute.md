# How to contribute

This documentation is open [source and public](#deal-with-confidentiality-privacy), everyone's contribution is highly recommanded.  

- [Project on Github](https://github.com/O2do-repository/O2Doc)

## Contribute like code

### No idea of what could be your contribution? 

- Just drop links to existing web content.  Contribution doesn't mean reinventing the wheel. 
- Reformulating, adding example, or simply refactor the structure of the content.  Contribution is also about enhancing content.  
- Why not just writing down the conclusion of the last debate you had with your colleagues? 
- Drop a list of subject to tackle and ping your friends. 
- Discuss about your colleagues what they would like.
- Did you already explained something twice to two different colleagues?  Then just write it down. 
- Have you learned anything new recently?  Could it be a subject? 

Start small... think big!

### Not time right now? --> Open an issue

If you see something
- that needs to be changed
- that doesn't work as expected
- that should be added (like new content)

but you have no time to do it now?  Don't loose your idea! 
**Open an issue** on our Github. 

### Clone the repo and submit your pull request

Every contribution is welcome, we just require the review of one other colleague as we believe in the 4-eyes principle.
